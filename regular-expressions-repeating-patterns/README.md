# Regular Expressions / Regular Expressions Repeating Patterns

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Regular Expressions](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/regular-expressions) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

Repeating a pattern is an important part of regular expressions. It allows you to write part of a pattern only once instead of copying-and-pasting it multiple times.


We recommend our [Back to Basics: Regular Expressions] article to learn about how regular expressions work.
