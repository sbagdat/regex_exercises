# Regular Expressions / Regular Expressions Advanced

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Regular Expressions](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/regular-expressions) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

Grouping is one of the most powerful aspects of regular expressions - it lets you match portions of the string and refer to them later, instead of having one big match.

In this problem, you'll be reformatting phone numbers into a standard format.

You can read more about grouping in [the documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Regexp.html#class-Regexp-label-Grouping) or [this blog post](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/back-to-basics-regular-expressions). You will also probably want to check the documentation for [String#gsub](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/String.html#method-i-gsub).

[Rubular](http://rubular.com/) is a fantastic website for getting quick feedback about your regex.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/regular-expressions-advanced.git
    cd regular-expressions-advanced
    bin/setup

First, run `bin/setup`, then run `rake ` to see the failing tests.

Make the tests pass one by one.

You can run `rake` at any point to re-run the tests.
