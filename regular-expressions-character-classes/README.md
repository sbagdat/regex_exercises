# Regular Expressions / Regular Expressions Character Classes

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Regular Expressions](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/regular-expressions) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

Instead of matching specific characters like "a" or "9", we can use character classes to match things like "any letter", "any number", or "any whitespace".

We recommend [this article](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/back-to-basics-regular-expressions) for an introduction to regular expressions.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/regular-expressions-character-classes.git
    cd regular-expressions-character-classes
    bin/setup

First, run `bin/setup`.

Then run `rake` to run the tests and see the failures.

Go through the `lib/character_classes.rb` file from top to bottom and fix each failure one by one.

Run `rake` at any time to re-run the tests. To run a specific file, use `rspec spec/name_of_file_spec.rb`.

There are a few pending specs that will show up when you run the tests. Once you've solved every other test, remove the `pending` line and try solving them.
