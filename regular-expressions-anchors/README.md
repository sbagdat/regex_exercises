# Regular Expressions / Regular Expressions Anchors

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Regular Expressions](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/regular-expressions) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

Anchors in regular expressions are a powerful tool that allows you to be much more precise in what you match. Instead of matching "a" anywhere in a string, you can match "a" at the start or end of a string.

For more, check out the [documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Regexp.html#class-Regexp-label-Anchors).

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/regular-expressions-anchors.git
    cd regular-expressions-anchors
    bin/setup

First, run `bin/setup`.

Then, run `rake` to see the failing tests. You can run `rake` at any point to see the test results again.

Fill in the methods in `lib/anchors.rb` to make the tests pass.
